The artist of interest is always displayed on the center of the canvas with the related artists revolving around them. Additionally,
the colors of the artists represent their popularities. The colors from the least popular to most popular are black, purple, blue, cyan, 
green, yellow, orange, red, and white.

The application also utilizes MongoDB to keep track of users' most recent searches and the authorization tokens required to access the Spotify API.
